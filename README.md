# Mise Bats Support Libraries

Adds `bats-support` library support to mise. This library primarily makes the submodules available for use in `bats` tests, similar to the [`bats-action`](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-action) GitHub Action.

You will likely want to use this library in conjunction with `mise-bats` and [`mise-bats-assert`](#TODO).

## Installation

Install from the Github repository:

```bash
mise plugin install bats-support https://github.com/zerodahero/mise-bats-support
```

## Future

- [ ] Create a backend plugin instead for all bats libraries/add-ons
